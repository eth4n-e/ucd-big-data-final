# UCD Big Data Project

### Group Members: Lindsay Atkinson & Ethan Epperson


##### The Project Utilizes A Big Five Personality Dataset

The Big Five Personality Test dataset used in this analysis consists of over 1 million responses from an online personality test, measuring individual personalities based on their alignment with the ‘Big Five’ traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each participant answered 50 Likert-scale questions, while additional data regarding completion time, location and other interaction metrics - were also recorded to track their engagement with the survey.

##### Development Environment

Google Colab's Runtime Environment was the preferred mode of development, yet in the final stages of the project presented challenges with configuring and employing big data processing via Spark Core API due to policy restrictions and a limit to runtime resources
